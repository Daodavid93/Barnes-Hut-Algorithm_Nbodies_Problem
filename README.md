      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Softmax function maybe is one of the most popular Machine learning algorithm basically, it turns arbitrary real values into probabilities, by using the exponential function. It could be considered a generalization of the sigmoid function. We could use softmax for multi-class classification furthermore it is met in many various fields of science as Statistical physics (Gibbs distributions), Quantum statistic, Information theory, and Neural networks. Softmax is much attractive in classification problems since it has a simple implementation and in many cases gives satisfying results and enough good performance.
