# N-bodies problem




##### The only way to solve force iteraction between n bodies ,where n>2 is numerical approach.It can not be find the solution with common analitical itegration.The solution involve complexity O(n)=2âˆ—k.h.n2 number of itergration step ,where h = itegration step or time step,k count of itegration and k.v=t t-time,The multiplier 2 is because that is second order DU.In this paper we will see how this complexity can be reduced to O(n log n) or O(n) by using Barnes-Hut and Leapfrogs algorithms
